Zero-config Add agent in the deployed harness.

- `@render-harness/web`: new `GET /agents/catalog` route proxies the wizard catalog same-origin so the browser never crosses origins (the wizard ships no CORS headers). Response is cached in-process for 60s. The proxy and the existing add/install/edit-model routes now default the wizard URL server-side; `RENDER_HARNESS_WIZARD_URL` becomes an opt-in override.
- `@render-harness/wizard`: `listAddableAgents` now flattens every gallery entry, not just bundles. `planAgentAdd` accepts agents that reference a builtin (no `agent.entrypoint`) and produces a null `sourceFilePath` so the route skips the src/ probe and write. Single-agent gallery entries (chat, support-bot, research-cron, work-monitor) are addable from the operator UI.
- `@render-harness/registry`: `enrichDeploymentInfo` defaults `wizardServiceUrl` to the public wizard. The Config tab's description of `RENDER_HARNESS_WIZARD_URL` is reworded to "override only" and `WIZARD_SHARED_SECRET`'s description is clarified. The gallery loader walks `src/` for every entry kind so single-agent entries that ship custom source are picked up too.
- `@render-harness/ui`: Add agent panel is always visible on the Agents tab and shows a one-line hint when the deployment can't commit (missing repo locator / shared secret). The catalog modal swaps the flat `<select>` for a filterable card grid, surfaces actionable error codes (`needs_install`, `wizard_shared_secret_not_configured`, `repo_locator_missing`, `wizard_service_not_configured`), and reuses `useDeployWatch` + the toaster so successful adds show committed → restarting → restored with a Reload action.
