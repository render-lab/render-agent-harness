## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- c2cc5c6: `PUT /config/env-vars/:name` now explicitly POSTs to
  `/v1/services/:id/deploys` with `deployMode: "deploy_only"` after the
  env-var write succeeds. Render's env-var API endpoint only persists
  the value — it does not roll the service — so the previous flow
  saved the new value but the running container kept the old
  `process.env`. Symptoms: clicking "Save & restart" in the Config tab
  appeared to do nothing, and toggling Vitals (which writes
  `RENDER_HARNESS_VITALS_ENABLED`) never flipped the feature on
  because the freshly-saved env never made it into a restarted
  process. The response now reports `restart: "queued"` or
  `restart: "save_only"` (with a `deployError` payload) so the UI can
  surface when Render rejected the deploy trigger and the operator
  needs to redeploy manually.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Expose each package's `./package.json` through its `exports` map. Without this, modern Node's exports-based resolution rejects `require("@render-harness/<name>/package.json")`, which is exactly the lookup `@render-harness/registry`'s `readPackageVersion` uses to detect running harness versions for the operator UI. The operator UI was showing "Harness version is unknown — No running @render-harness package versions could be detected" for every consumer of the published packages.
- Updated dependencies
  - @render-harness/contracts@0.2.1
  - @render-harness/core@0.2.1

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Realign with the rest of the `@render-harness/*` harness family at `0.2.0`. No code changes — version bump only, so `create-render-agent` scaffolds that pin every `@render-harness/*` dep to `^0.2` resolve `ui` too.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- Fix module-script MIME-type errors when the operator UI is mounted at root (`path: "/"`). The SPA shell references hashed asset bundles at top-level paths (e.g. `/chunk-CSCIHK7Q-Bo3glXo1.js`); the mount now serves them from `bundled-gallery`'s `static/assets/` for the root-mount case instead of falling through to the SPA HTML.

## 0.1.4
