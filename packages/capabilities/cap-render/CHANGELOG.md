# @render-harness/cap-render

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 03f9f11: Edit system prompts in the operator UI's Agents tab. New `PATCH /agents/:slug/system-prompt` route on `@render-harness/web` clones the managed repo via the same deploy-key path that powers the model edit, rewrites `agents[i].agent.systemPrompt` in `render-harness.yaml`, commits, and lets Render auto-deploy roll out the change. The Agents tab grows an "edit" affordance next to the system-prompt section for builtin (`kind: chat`) agents; custom (`kind: custom`) agents stay read-only and surface a "defined in `<entrypoint>` — edit in code and redeploy" hint instead, because their prompt lives in TypeScript source.

  Pieces:
  - **`@render-harness/core`** — new `AgentSource` type and optional `source` field on `AgentDefinition`. Populated by the registry; unset for hand-authored `defineAgent({...})` calls.
  - **`@render-harness/registry`** — new `mutateAgentSystemPrompt` mutator + `AgentNotEditableError` in `repo-mutations`. `defineChatAgent` stamps `source: { kind: "builtin" }`; `defineFromConfig` stamps `source: { kind: "custom", entrypoint }` on dynamic-imported agents. Multi-line prompts emit as `|` block scalars so the on-disk YAML stays readable; round-trip through `parseDocument` preserves comments and unrelated fields.
  - **`@render-harness/contracts`** — `AgentSummary` grows `source` and `systemPrompt` (full body). The full prompt is already accessible via `runAgent` at runtime; surfacing it on `GET /agents` lets the operator UI populate its edit modal without a second round-trip.
  - **`@render-harness/web`** — new route mounted in `serveWeb`. Deploy-key path is preferred; falls through to wizard-proxy for harnesses scaffolded before May 2026's GITHUB_DEPLOY_KEY migration. Returns 409 `agent_not_editable` (with `entrypoint` pointer) when the targeted agent is `kind: custom`.
  - **`@render-harness/ui`** — `EditSystemPromptModal` with a resizable textarea, char count, 50,000-char limit, and the same committed → restarting → restored toast chain the existing edit-model and install-capability flows use.
  - **`@render-harness/wizard`** — new `PATCH /api/agents/:slug/system-prompt` route. Sibling of `/api/agents/:slug/model`, same `WIZARD_SHARED_SECRET` auth + Octokit commit shape, same deprecation log warning operators to rotate to the deploy-key path.

  Per [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/render-lab/render-agent-harness/blob/main/AGENTS.md#minor-bumps-must-be-coordinated-across-the-whole-family) this is a coordinated minor cut: every published first-party harness package goes to the same `0.8.0` baseline so `harnessVersion: "^0.8.0"` in scaffolded `render-harness.yaml` files satisfies every dep. Existing managed harnesses need a manual bump of `harnessVersion` and their `@render-harness/*` dep ranges before the new route is reachable; the scaffolded `render-harness.yaml` is updated automatically by `bundle-gallery.ts`.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 0a772da: Coordinated 0.7.0 minor cut: per-harness SSH deploy keys replace `WIZARD_SHARED_SECRET` for edit-in-UI commits.

  **What changed for harness operators**
  - New transport for the operator UI's Install capability and Edit model flows: the deployed harness clones its own managed repo via SSH using a per-deployment `GITHUB_DEPLOY_KEY`, runs the same pure planner/mutator the wizard used to run, and pushes the commit directly. No wizard in the path.
  - Wizard scaffold flow (`/new`) generates an ed25519 keypair, registers the public half on the new repo as a deploy key with write access, and surfaces the private key + `GITHUB_DEPLOY_REPO_SSH_URL` on the scaffold-done page with copy buttons for the Render Blueprint env-var prompt.
  - CLI-scaffolded harnesses can self-serve via the new `npx create-render-agent deploy-key [--repo owner/name]` subcommand — generates a keypair and prints paste-ready instructions for the GitHub deploy-key page and the Render Environment tab.
  - Add agent (`POST /agents/add`) still proxies through the wizard with `WIZARD_SHARED_SECRET` in Wave 1 (it depends on runtime-entries templates that live in `create-render-agent`); a follow-up minor cut will move it to the deploy-key path too. Until then, keep `WIZARD_SHARED_SECRET` set alongside the deploy-key vars if you use Add agent.

  **What changed in the published API**
  - `@render-harness/registry` exports two new subpaths:
    - `@render-harness/registry/deploy-keys` — pure `generateDeployKeypair()` returning OpenSSH-format ed25519 keys, suitable for both wizard scaffold and the CLI subcommand. Shared so both stay byte-identical.
    - `@render-harness/registry/repo-mutations` — re-export of the pure `planCapabilityInstall`, `mutateCapabilityInstallYaml`, `mutateAgentModel`, `planAgentAdd`, etc., previously private to the wizard. Consumed by both the wizard's existing routes and the harness's new deploy-key commit path so they share one implementation of every YAML mutation.
  - `@render-harness/contracts` adds `repoSshUrl?: string | null` to `DeploymentInfo.repoLocator`. Backfilled in `enrichDeploymentInfo` from `org` + `repo` as `git@github.com:<org>/<repo>.git` when an explicit SSH URL isn't pinned in `.render-harness/agent.json`.
  - `@render-harness/web` adds `packages/web/src/lib/git-commit.ts` (`withRepoClone`, `commitFilesToRepo`) plus `packages/web/src/lib/commit-shim.ts` (`pickCommitPath`). The `capability-install` and `agent-model` routes wire these in with a back-compat fallback to the wizard proxy when `WIZARD_SHARED_SECRET` is set but `GITHUB_DEPLOY_KEY` isn't.
  - `@render-harness/registry/emitter` adds `GITHUB_DEPLOY_KEY` and `GITHUB_DEPLOY_REPO_SSH_URL` as `sync: false` envVars on every UI-enabled web service in the generated `render.yaml`. The Config tab's `implicitOperationalVars` learns about both; `WIZARD_SHARED_SECRET`'s description is reworded as legacy.
  - `create-render-agent`'s `.env.example` template appends commented-out `GITHUB_DEPLOY_KEY` / `GITHUB_DEPLOY_REPO_SSH_URL` blocks (only when `ui: true`) alongside the existing `WEB_API_KEY` / `UI_COOKIE_SECRET` block.

  **Deprecation**

  The wizard's `/api/capabilities/install`, `/api/agents/add`, `/api/agents/:slug/model` routes still accept `Authorization: Bearer WIZARD_SHARED_SECRET` and continue to function for harnesses scaffolded before this cut. Each route logs a one-shot deprecation warning on first authenticated hit per process. These endpoints will be removed in a future minor cut; rotate harnesses to deploy keys when convenient. See `docs-site/src/content/docs/managed-repo-commits.mdx` for the operator-facing setup walkthrough.

  **Runtime requirements**

  The deploy-key flow shells out to the system `git` binary plus OpenSSH client (`ssh`). Both are present in Render's native Node runtime per https://render.com/docs/native-runtimes#tools-and-utilities. Custom Dockerfile users should ensure `git` and `openssh-client` are installed; the harness defensively probes at first use and surfaces an actionable `git binary not on PATH` error if missing.

  **Why coordinated minor**

  Per `AGENTS.md` "Minor bumps must be coordinated across the whole family" — `@render-harness/registry`, `@render-harness/contracts`, and `@render-harness/web` ship breaking-shape changes (new exports, new `repoLocator.repoSshUrl` field, new commit-shim route shape) and the runtime version check would red-banner every existing managed harness if any first-party package crossed 0.7 without the rest. Every first-party package + every capability pack bumps to 0.7.0 together.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Coordinated 0.6.0 minor cut. Capability packs can now declare SQL migrations via a new `migrations` slot on the `CapabilityPack` contract; the harness applies them at boot before any agent code runs.

  **`@render-harness/core`** — new `MigrationFile` and `PackMigration` interface exports. `applyMigrations(pool, opts?)` gains an optional second argument: when `opts.packMigrations` is non-empty, pack-contributed migrations run after core migrations under the same advisory lock. Each pack migration runs in its own transaction; on success `(packName, id)` is recorded in a new `agent_pack_migrations` core table (added via new core migration `0005_pack_migrations.sql`), so subsequent boots skip already-applied entries cheaply. A failing pack migration aborts boot with an actionable error naming the pack + migration id, and rolls back its transaction so the DB isn't left half-migrated. `AgentDefinition` gains an optional `packMigrations?: PackMigration[]` field that `defineFromConfig` populates from loaded packs. The single-arg `applyMigrations(pool)` call site stays backward-compatible — existing code keeps working unchanged.

  **`@render-harness/contracts`** — no public-surface change; bumped to keep the family coordinated.

  **`@render-harness/registry`** — `CapabilityPack` contract gains an optional `migrations?: (ctx: PackContext) => MigrationFile[] | Promise<MigrationFile[]>` slot. The zod validator at `assertCapabilityPack` accepts the new field. `defineFromConfig` walks every loaded pack's `migrations` callback, prefixes each entry with `packName`, and surfaces the collected list on `AgentDefinition.packMigrations`. The runner dedupes by `(packName, id)`, so the same pack contributed across multiple agents in a bundle is applied once. `MigrationFile` and `PackMigration` are re-exported from `@render-harness/registry` for pack-author convenience.

  **`@render-harness/runtime-cron`, `runtime-web`, `runtime-worker`, `runtime-workflows`, `web`** — each runtime adapter now passes `{ packMigrations: agent.packMigrations ?? [] }` (or, for the multi-agent shapes, the merged flat list across all known agents) into `applyMigrations` at boot. The trigger-side `applyMigrations` call in `runtime-workflows/triggerAgentWorkflow` stays single-arg — it only needs core tables for the `ensureRun` insert that follows.

  **`create-render-agent`** — generated scaffold entries (`src/runtime/cron-entry.ts`, `worker-entry.ts`) call `applyMigrations(pool, { packMigrations: agent.packMigrations ?? [] })` instead of `applyMigrations(pool)`. New scaffolds inherit pack-migration support automatically; existing scaffolded deployments need to either re-scaffold or manually update the entry file.

  **Every published `@render-harness/cap-*` pack** — bumped to stay on the same 0.6 baseline. No behavioral change in the existing packs; the new `migrations` slot is opt-in.

  **Operators upgrading existing deployments** need to:
  1. Bump `harnessVersion` in `render-harness.yaml` to `"^0.6.0"`.
  2. Bump every `"@render-harness/*"` dep range in `package.json` to `"^0.6.0"`.
  3. If the deployment uses an old scaffolded entry, update the `applyMigrations(pool)` call to `applyMigrations(pool, { packMigrations: agent.packMigrations ?? [] })`. Without this, packs using `migrations` will silently have nothing applied.

  See `docs-site/src/content/docs/authoring-capability-packs.mdx#migrations` for the pack-author walkthrough and the [`docs/capabilities-shipping-plan.md`](docs/capabilities-shipping-plan.md) Phase 1.5 entry for the design rationale.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Initial release. First-party capability pack that wires the hosted Render MCP (`https://mcp.render.com/mcp`) for managing Render workspaces — services, deploys, databases, env vars, logs.

  Surfaces:
  - One MCP server (HTTP transport) named `render` — namespaced by the loader to `cap-render.render`. Skipped at boot with a `console.warn` when `RENDER_API_KEY` is unset, mirroring `cap-search-exa`'s safe-default behavior so a missing key doesn't crash unrelated agents.
  - Three bundled skills (`render-overview`, `render-deploy-flow`, `render-logs-and-debug`) loadable via the built-in `load_skill` tool.
  - One env-schema entry for `RENDER_API_KEY`.
  - Exported `RENDER_MCP_MUTATING_TOOLS` constant listing the 12 known destructive Render MCP tools, so consumer agents can paste it into `permissions.requireApproval` for HITL. The list is documentation today — there's no pack-level `permissions` slot on `CapabilityPack` (yet); agents still declare `requireApproval` themselves.

  Config keys:
  - `apiKeyEnv` (string, default `"RENDER_API_KEY"`) — override the env var name to read for the bearer token.
  - `baseUrl` (string, default `"https://mcp.render.com/mcp"`) — override for staging or self-hosted Render MCP endpoints.

  Migration note for the existing `examples/deploy-agent` and `gallery/agents/deploy-agent`: the raw `mcpServers:` block is replaced with `capabilities: [{ pack: "@render-harness/cap-render" }]`. `permissions.requireApproval` stays declared on the agent (the pack constant exists for documentation; the agent author still copies it in).
