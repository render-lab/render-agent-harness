# @render-harness/cap-scrape-firecrawl

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- Skip MCP server registration with a `console.warn` when the pack's API key env var is unset, instead of throwing.

  `defineFromConfig` walks every capability pack for every agent in the manifest at boot. A `throw` inside `pack.mcpServers(ctx)` crashed _every_ service in the bundle — web, worker, cron — even ones that didn't use the affected pack. The new behavior leaves the agent boot intact; the pack's tools are simply absent until the operator sets the key, and the missing key is surfaced through a single stderr warning instead of a crash loop. `cap-scrape-firecrawl`'s `localTools` callback already gated on the same key and continues to return `[]`.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 2c465b3: Per-end-user OAuth connection API + `cap-google` (Gmail + Calendar).

  This is a coordinated minor cut. Every first-party harness package crosses `0.4 → 0.5` together because the platform additions touch every layer:

  **`@render-harness/core`** — new `OAuthProviderConfig`, encrypted token storage (`agent_user_connections`), per-run `SecretsContext` built from the run's `userId`, refresh-on-use with provider-rotation handling, `NeedsConnectionError`, and a process-level OAuth provider registry. New SQL migration `0004_connections.sql`. `LocalToolHandler.handler` args gain optional `userId` and `secrets: SecretsContext` (additive — existing packs keep compiling).

  **`@render-harness/contracts`** — `UserConnectionSummary`, `ConnectionProviderSummary`, `ConnectionsResp`, `StartConnectionResp`, `DeleteConnectionResp`.

  **`@render-harness/registry`** — `CapabilityPack.oauthProviders` and `connectionsRequired` fields; `defineFromConfig` auto-registers providers from loaded packs.

  **`@render-harness/web`** — `/connections/:provider/start|callback`, `GET /connections`, `DELETE /connections/:provider` routes; Diagnostics surfaces `CONNECTIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and per-provider OAuth client credential checks.

  **`@render-harness/ui`** — new Connections tab in the operator UI; `listConnections` / `startConnection` / `deleteConnection` API helpers.

  **`@render-harness/cap-google`** (new) — Gmail (`gmail.search`, `gmail.get_message`, `gmail.send`, `gmail.modify_labels`) + Calendar (`calendar.list_events`, `calendar.get_event`, `calendar.freebusy`, `calendar.create_event`, `calendar.update_event`, `calendar.delete_event`) tools backed by the connection API. Adds Google as the first registered OAuth provider with `access_type=offline` + `prompt=consent` so refresh tokens are returned. Read-only mode (`accessMode: "read"`) drops the write tools and narrows scopes.

  Operators upgrading existing deployments need to:
  1. Set `CONNECTIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (32 random bytes, base64) on the harness service.
  2. For each provider, register an OAuth 2.0 client and set its client id/secret env vars.
  3. Update `harnessVersion` in `render-harness.yaml` and `@render-harness/*` dep ranges in `package.json` to `^0.5.0`.

  See `docs/connections-api.md` for the full design and `docs-site/src/content/docs/connections-api.mdx` for the user-facing guide.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- cap-slack: stop surfacing raw Slack user and channel IDs to agents.
  - `slack.get_thread` and `slack.get_channel_history` now auto-resolve user IDs and the queried channel ID, attach `user_display_name` per message, rewrite `<@U…>` and `<#C…|name>` references in `text_resolved`, and return `resolved_users` / `resolved_channel` maps in the response.
  - Adds two new read tools: `slack.get_user_info` and `slack.get_channel_info` for on-demand lookups (for example to label IDs the agent sees in attachments, payload metadata, or operator-provided text).
  - Lookups share an in-memory cache scoped to the agent process so repeated calls stay cheap across turns.

  The new tools trigger a coordinated family-wide minor bump per AGENTS.md "Minor bumps must be coordinated across the whole family". The other listed packages are packaging-only bumps with no behavioral change.

  `@render-harness/web` also drops its `@render-harness/ui` peerDependency in this cut. Web has never imported the UI statically — it dynamic-imports `@render-harness/ui` inside `wrapWithUiSessionIfAvailable` / `mountUiIfAvailable` with a guarded fallback. The peer declaration was advisory only, and it was the sole reason Changesets cascaded `web` to a MAJOR bump during every coordinated minor cut (see commit `420c904`'s manual workaround). Consumers that want the operator UI install `@render-harness/ui` explicitly alongside `@render-harness/web` exactly as before; the scaffolder already adds it as a regular dependency when `ui` is selected, so no scaffold changes are required.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- Expose each package's `./package.json` through its `exports` map. Without this, modern Node's exports-based resolution rejects `require("@render-harness/<name>/package.json")`, which is exactly the lookup `@render-harness/registry`'s `readPackageVersion` uses to detect running harness versions for the operator UI. The operator UI was showing "Harness version is unknown — No running @render-harness package versions could be detected" for every consumer of the published packages.
