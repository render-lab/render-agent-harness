# @render-harness/registry

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- 70ab0f4: Zero-config Add agent in the deployed harness.
  - `@render-harness/web`: new `GET /agents/catalog` route proxies the wizard catalog same-origin so the browser never crosses origins (the wizard ships no CORS headers). Response is cached in-process for 60s. The proxy and the existing add/install/edit-model routes now default the wizard URL server-side; `RENDER_HARNESS_WIZARD_URL` becomes an opt-in override.
  - `@render-harness/wizard`: `listAddableAgents` now flattens every gallery entry, not just bundles. `planAgentAdd` accepts agents that reference a builtin (no `agent.entrypoint`) and produces a null `sourceFilePath` so the route skips the src/ probe and write. Single-agent gallery entries (chat, support-bot, research-cron, work-monitor) are addable from the operator UI.
  - `@render-harness/registry`: `enrichDeploymentInfo` defaults `wizardServiceUrl` to the public wizard. The Config tab's description of `RENDER_HARNESS_WIZARD_URL` is reworded to "override only" and `WIZARD_SHARED_SECRET`'s description is clarified. The gallery loader walks `src/` for every entry kind so single-agent entries that ship custom source are picked up too.
  - `@render-harness/ui`: Add agent panel is always visible on the Agents tab and shows a one-line hint when the deployment can't commit (missing repo locator / shared secret). The catalog modal swaps the flat `<select>` for a filterable card grid, surfaces actionable error codes (`needs_install`, `wizard_shared_secret_not_configured`, `repo_locator_missing`, `wizard_service_not_configured`), and reuses `useDeployWatch` + the toaster so successful adds show committed → restarting → restored with a Reload action.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- Relax `buildHarnessVersionInfo`'s mixed-version check. Patch-level drift across the harness family is expected: `@render-harness/web` cascade-bumps when its internal `@render-harness/ui` dep patches, and capability packs version on their own tracks. The previous logic flagged any unique-version count > 1 as a warning, which made the operator UI show "First-party harness packages are running mixed versions" even when every installed version still satisfied the declared range. The check now only warns when at least one running version falls outside the declared range.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Expose each package's `./package.json` through its `exports` map. Without this, modern Node's exports-based resolution rejects `require("@render-harness/<name>/package.json")`, which is exactly the lookup `@render-harness/registry`'s `readPackageVersion` uses to detect running harness versions for the operator UI. The operator UI was showing "Harness version is unknown — No running @render-harness package versions could be detected" for every consumer of the published packages.
